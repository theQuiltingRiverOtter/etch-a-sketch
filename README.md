Etch A Sketch Application for The Odin Project


Description: This application is built to simulate the function of an etch a sketch. By moving the mouse over the grid of squares, the user will be able to 'draw' on the grid. The project is an assignment from The Odin Project and is built using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. It should allow the user to select a different number of cells in the grid and to choose between basic black, rainbow, and greyscale values for colors,
